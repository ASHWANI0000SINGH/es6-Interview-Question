question and ans
1. JS is dynamic langusage?
> Data types of variable can change during run time.
2.how js determine data type
> by value
3. Different type of data type
>string, number,bigInt,boolean,undefined,null,symbol
>Object
4. Explained undefined ind data type
> value is not initilaized
5.explain null and undefined
>null is absence of data while undefined is not initilized 
6. Hoisting(var)
>Hositing is a mechanism where variable declaration movee top of the scope before the code execute 
7.Explain global variable;
>Which is aceesible everwhere.
8. What happens when u declare var without var
>It becomes global variable
9. use strict
> It checs wethere vaiable us assigned with var , let or const
10.What are closures
>Closures gives access to an outer function scope from inner function.
 in closure we can also return the function 
but iy will still remeber the refrence of outer scope of the variable
11. IIFE
>Imeediately invoked fundtion
anonymous function gets invoked immediately 
12.Inheritance in javascript?
>inhertance enable us to define a class and takes all the
 functionlity of the parent method/properties 
13. What is prototyoe in js?
>Prototypes are the mechanism by which
 JavaScript objects inherit features from one another 

14. Explain Prototype chaining?
>Prototype chining is the process where the property/method
is first checked in current obj
then it goes to the protype obj
the protypes protype objct, untill the prototype object uis null

15. let variable
>block scope
let hositing happens 
but it doesnot assign any value , refernce err
cant access x its not initilaized

16.Temeral dead zone
state of variable is there in menory but it doesnot have value

17. let vs var
> scoping -var function scope
scoping let immediate enclosing block scope
initilaization- variable declartion top
hoisting var and let both
var -initialized undefined
let -will not be initalized by any value (exception)
